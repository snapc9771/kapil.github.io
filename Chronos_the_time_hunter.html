[7 Years ago]

Jack Hudson one of the greatest detective in the world. Age 21 years. Born in Paris and now living in New York City. First to be one of the greatest detective in the world at this age.
            
Even today he has captured a bomb implanter with his sharp instincts. As he came out of the courtroom, reporters surrounded him. He wore his glasses to protect his eyes from all the flashlights. 
            
“How did you become successful in capturing the culprit when no one else has been able to figure out even one thing about him?” A female reporter in front asks him. “There is no one in this whole world who can think ahead of me”, he replied.
            
Then suddenly an 11-12 years old child came out from this crowd of reporters. He immediately captures everyone’s attention. “Who are you kid?” Jack asked him. “My name is Ray Watson”, he replied. “You have convicted my father for killing 4 of his fellow scientists 1 month ago. Now they are going to execute him. I want you to reopen that case and take a good look for the real culprit because I have this strong feeling that someone has trapped my father in this blood sport. Please I beg of you sir, my mother is very sick right now. If you don’t do this I am going to lose everything.”
            
Smile spread on his face after hearing this. He saw Ray with very miserable eyes. “I am very impressed on how you talking at this small age but I am very sorry to hear that your father is one of those goon criminals”, he said. “If I was on your position, I certainly have shot my father because there is no person or power in this world that can over smart me. My final decision is the ultimate justice.”
            
After hearing this tears starts twinkling on that small boy’s face with the flashes of cameras. No one hear him sobbing between the clicking of cameras and some laughing people in the crowd. He pushed them apart and ran from there. 

            
            
[Present Day 20 March, 2020 11:03 PM]

Jack Hudson was very busy today. There are no time limits in these crime investigations. It is already midnight and he is very late for candle light dinner with his girlfriend. There is no one with him. He is very tired and searching for his car in the parking lot. He came close to his car after seeing it and as he press the unlock button on his key, in its headlight he saw someone standing in front of his car. Before he can do anything that stranger shot him. On hitting Jack find that it is not a bullet but it is an anesthetic dart. That worked on him very quickly. He squatted to save himself from falling. 
            
"Don’t panic detective", stranger said. "This dart was only to calm you. You will be all right in few minutes. And be happy because I have good news for you. You are going into the future."
            
After saying it he set time on his watch and on pressing its button a small silver ball came out from it. He throws it ahead of him and it form a big ring which is filled with a blue light. He grabbed Jack’s arm and pushed the lightly fainted Jack into that blue light. 
            
It was midnight and not even dogs want to come in this dark street at this time. But there was one person Jack Hudson laying there. When he opened his eyes he find himself laying there on that street. His head is spinning right now but he still stood up. He doesn’t have any idea where he is. So he brings out his mobile from his pocket. There is no network to show him where he is and the time is few minutes more then he previously saw. Then he starts walking toward the bright lights of the city. His throat is very dry right now. So he entered into a bar and asks for a glass of water. After drinking the water he immediately fell asleep on the table. He remain there for the whole night.
“Wake up sleepyhead”, said the man working on the counter. “It’s already morning.”
            
            
He woke up immediately after hearing this. Now he is feeling okay but he doesn’t have a clue where he is. “Where am I?” He asked the bartender.
            
“You are in Night’s King Bar..... New York City right now”, he replied very surprisingly. “But you only have drunk one glass of water yesterday. Did it always happen when you even drink water?”
            
He didn’t listen him after he said New York. He is very surprise that he don’t know about this place even when it is so close to his house. He was ready to leave that bar when he suddenly saw some kids with mobiles. He hasn’t seen any mobile like this before. There was an odd feeling he is getting from the moment he wake up. Then suddenly he remembers the last thing he has listen before coming here. That stranger was saying something about future. On coming this thought into his mind he immediately snatch cell phone from one of the kid. That kid is hitting him to give back his phone but he just want to check today’s date. He gets goose bumps after checking the date. It showed 21 March, 2024, 4 years into the future. Then he takes a good look around him and because he is a detective he immediately notices some advancement. 
“What year is it?” He asked the bartender.            
“What? Of course it is 2024”, Bartender replied even more surprisingly. “Man you are the only person on this Earth who can get so high with just water.”
            
When he stepped out of the bar in confusion he saw many vehicles running on the roads which are not present in 2020. Although he remembers this place but still there are many new things he saw first time. Then he starts walking in nervousness. He saw many magazines, newspapers and asked some people about today’s date, he came to the conclusion that he has traveled 4 years into the future. Then only thing comes into his mind was to get to his home and talk to somebody he knew and tell him about his situation. But when he reaches his place he find that now his house belongs to someone else. Then troubled he again starts walking to get some answers. Then he gets an idea and borrows a mobile from an old man sitting on a bench in the park he passing by. On the internet he typed his name to get some information about him. He came to know that he has been disappeared from last 4 years. Everyone searched for him but he was never found. Many people now believe that he has been already dead.
            
Terrified he starts running towards some trees in that park. “He was right”, someone murmured from behind those trees. Jack immediately identified him. He was the same person who has sent him here 4 years into the future. Same clothes, same voice and this time also he shot Jack before he can do anything. 
            
When Jack opened his eyes he find himself in a big room bound up to a chair with chains. “Who are you?” He shouted on the stranger who had done all this to him. 
            
That stranger took a chair and sit in front of him. He slipped his hood behind his neck and there was this 22-23 year boy in that. “Who are you?” He again shouted on him.
            
“It is obvious you have had forget me”, that boy replied. “I think you have forgotten but we have met what may be 11 years ago. It is so difficult to keep track of time in these confusing leaps. I was very small at that time. My dad has died because of you.”
            
Than after thinking very deeply he remember that this boy is the son of that man whom he has convicted to execute 11 years ago. “So now you are taking revenge on me”, Jack said. “And where did you get that time machine?”
            
“No no brother I am not taking any revenge”, Ray said. “I am living a completely new life from a few years now. I also become a scientist walking on my father’s footsteps. If you don’t trust me you can read everything about me in NASA. I have invented many things for them that can help them ease there long journeys in outer space. And if you talk about time machine, it is a very long story. Then on the other hand he has told me to tell you everything very clearly so you can defend yourself.”
“Who told you what? What are you talking about?” Jack again shouted on Ray.
            
“He goes by the name of Chronos, Chronos the Time Hunter”, Ray replied with heaviness in his voice. “He called you in 2044 so that he can hunt you. He didn’t want to come himself so he called you there. It will be the year 2044 from where the chase begins.” 
“Who is this Chronos the Time Hunter and why the hell did he wants to kill me?” Jack asked nervously.
“There is no one who can tell you about him exactly because nobody knows who he really is. He is like smoke nobody can catch him. He enjoys playing with his pray. He is in year 2044 right now although time is not a boundary for him. He is the one who sent my 2044 version into the past means in this year and told him about how I can catch you without leaving any trace behind. 

Then my future version told me and I traveled 4 years back into the past to capture you. Then I just came here after you. It was my future version who told me about where to find you today. My future version made it clear that if we don’t do exactly what the Chronos says then he will going to kill us. But on the other hand I have no second thought about capturing you because I think it is my pleasure to push you into the death well. I must tell you that my future version has told me that no one has ever escaped him after he has decided to hunt somebody.”
“But if your future version came to you then he will know exactly what is going to happen because it has also happened when he was of your age”, Jack said eagerly.
            
“You are a smart person Jack Hudson”, Ray said. “Yes it has already happened and that is why he told every little detail so that there will be no mistake because meaning of mistake here is death. Now be ready now I am sending you 20 years into the future.”
“If you know that you have to send me in 2044 from the start then why don’t you have done it in our first meeting in 2020”, Jack asked.
            
“It has two reasons. First reason is that I have to tell you everything what I have told you just now in a safe place because now after 4 years no one is looking for you. Space separated by time is better for talking without leaving any clue. And the second and the biggest reason is that time machine will only allows you to travel 22 years into the future or past at a time.”
“But how did a criminal like him get his hand on a time machine?” Jack asked.
            
“Jack you are a smart man. You want to know every little detail that can help you in your escape. But don’t get any wrong feelings. You are not going anywhere”, said Ray becoming very suspicious of his awareness. “And then on the other hand because I have a big mouth I can tell you a very funny thing. My future version has told me that it was 22 March of 2024 means tomorrow is the day when Chronos is first seen by anyone. After that he will going to be a worldwide news. He always wears a mask and a long coat. Tomorrow he will going to kill 30 people in a nearby mall. People that are very close to him say that he may have done it because may be this is the first incident because of which government invested in a project to make a machine that can travel into time to catch criminals like him. This is ultimately stolen by the Chronos in the year 2044. He himself becomes the creator of the time machine. This is a paradox because we are not able to change past. Now I am going to tell you one more thing. I don’t think that Chronos kills anyone without any reason. I think he is following a pattern to be the one who can control time with his fingers, resolving paradoxes, eliminating any contestant to be the God of time, to be The Chronos.”
“Okay you know enough now. My work here is almost finished. Time Hunter has told my future version to tell you that much things. Now I have 3 time seeds. I will use one of it to send you 20 years into future and the other two are for you.”
Even if Jack doesn’t want to, Ray wrapped the time watch on his arm. Ray used one time seed to open the portal and then make him lightly dizzy. “This is for the reason that you can get into the portal without any struggle”, Ray said. “There are two time seeds in it for you. You can use the time watch 2 times to hide in future or past because as I said Time Hunter wants to play with his pray before killing. And yes take these two sparklers with you”, Ray said giving him two guns. “You can also use them if you get a chance.” After saying that he unwind Jack from the chair and threw him into the portal. 
            
This time also when he opened his eyes he found himself on a dark deserted place. It is still very dark. But this time he was very alert. There was nothing much there but there was a dustbin at some distance. He wants to confirm that it really is 2044 so he ran toward the dustbin and empty it on the street. He searched for newspaper, pamphlets or other receipts that can show him today’s date. He was right. There were different dates on them but they all have the same year 2044. He has again traveled 20 years into the future.
            
And the most dreadful thing this time is that there was someone who is going to hunt him. He is shaking from the fear of unknown. Scared he run toward some trees and hide behind one of them. He find himself to be beaten to a frazzle. But he is not going to surrender to these circumstances. 
            
“There was a reason I was on the top from the moment I was born”, He murmured in passion. “I am not going to lose to a crazy time hopping beast. If he hasn’t lost to anyone to this day he better be prepared. But first of all I have to analyze my situation. I have nothing but two time seeds and two guns. If we are talking about time travel then I don’t think guns going to help me. With time seeds I can travel into the past or future but only 22 years at a time. So with combined I can travel what 44 years. But I don’t think that hiding into time can be of much help against a guy who I guess can have unlimited numbers of time seeds. Then other option is to stop him from kidnapping me at the first place. But if it has happened then it already has happened. It is a paradox and besides when I was in 2024 I checked that I am missing from last 4 years. So there is no way I can change that. So what other option did I have to defend myself against a guy who can be anywhere in the time.”
“Wait a minute”, he suddenly rise with a deep thought. “There is one way.” After saying it he came out from the trees with his guns and entered a date in the time watch. After that he opened a portal and enters into that.
            
When he came to his senses he found himself on the ground with some time left for sunrise. He gets up immediately and hides his guns under his coat. Then he borrowed a mobile phone from a man to check today’s date and time. It showed 22 March, 2024 and the time was 06:03 AM. Then he goes to a clothing shop and buys new shoes, a long coat and a mask from there with his money from 2020. He changed his clothes and hide guns under his long coat.
            
“Now I am going to be the one who can control time, who can call himself be The God Of Time, who can call himself be The Chronos”, He said loudly while putting a black hard clothed mask on his face. “I am going to do exactly the same things which Chronos had done so that I can be him and save myself. After all a paradox is allowed in the time travel. After my work is done here I am going to travel into 2044 and steel that time machine and then I am going to do things that no one has ever imagined. 
            
Yes I have to kill many people for that but now I am thinking about saving myself only and above that now it is the hunger of power flowing inside my veins.”
After reaching a shopping mall, he hit two security guards and enters into the mall. He pulls out his guns and starts firing on everyone present there. There was blood everywhere and people are crying but he didn’t stop. He even makes sure that he kills exactly 30 people. When he was satisfied and when he think that now police is approaching him, he entered the year 2044 into his watch and didn’t care about date because he knows that whatever will be the date he will going to be successful in steeling the time machine now. He used the last time seed and opened the time portal. He gazes at the police for a second and entered into the portal. 
            
This time when he woke up he find something heavy on his legs, arms and neck. He found himself laying on a bed in captivity and surrounded by armed police officers. It was a hospital. On seeing all this he agonies nervously. 
            
“Where am I?” He asked straightaway. Then a doctor and a police officer came close to him. “I am hundred percent sure that he is Jack Hudson”, Doctor said to the police officer.
            
“Okay now as you came to your senses, I want to ask you why the hell did you do that and where have you were from these many years Jack Hudson?” Officer asked. On the other side Jack also doesn’t know that how they capture him and what has happened here. “What year is it?”, Jack asked loudly.
            
“What do you mean what year is it. Of course it is 2024”, Officer replied a bit surprisingly. “But that means I never reached 2044. How is that possible”, Jack said shockingly. 
“What is this nonsense”, Officer said indignantly. “No this is not nonsense. This is not nonsense”, he murmured. “Where is my time machine?” He asked in a hurry. 
            
“Time machine?” Officer said even more surprisingly then previous. “Are you gone mad? Tell us exactly why you murdered all those innocent people or we have other ways to know”, Officer shouted on Jack.
            
“I murdered them? No I did it for a purpose. I did it only to become The Time Hunter. How does the timeline changed? It was a paradox. Can anyone tell me where the hell my fucking time machine is?” Jack shouted back on the Officer.
            
“What are you talking about? Is this the thing you are talking about?” Officer showed him an envelope containing time watch and the time seed with evidence written on it.
            
“Yes. Yes this is it”; He tried to grab that envelope. “This is my time machine", he said happily after a long time.
“This is not a time machine”, Officer said. “This is only a toy with a 3D projector and an anesthetic gas in this small round ball.”
“Whhhat.....” Suddenly Jack felt like the sky is fallen over him. “What..... No....... It was....... Oh my God.”
Suddenly every information joined inside his head like the pieces of a puzzle. At the very beginning when Ray anesthetize him, he kept him in a solution for 4 years in a condition like hyper sleep. He himself told him that he already had made things like that for NASA. He did it in a way so that he can deceive Jack to think that he has traveled in time. Then he makes him believe in an imaginary character Chronos so that he can manipulate him to do what he exactly wants. By using his misconception about time travel he make him believe that he can sent him into 2044. Writing 2044 on some newspapers and pamphlets was not a big task for him because he knows that this time Jack doesn’t look far to confirm the year and on the other hand wants to spent more time on his strategy. Ray was damn sure that at last Jack became convinced to be The Chronos himself because indirectly he closed all other doors for him earlier while talking. He used Jack’s over smartness against him because Jack always thinks 4 steps ahead of everyone. Every time he entered that blue light in that portal looking thing, an anesthetic gas is released and he gets into sleep. Ray is with him all that time and he is the one who take him into different places. There was never any past, no future and there was never any Time Machine. World’s greatest detective has been deceived. 
            
This is the reason Ray told him in their last meeting that his work is almost done now.
            
On having these thoughts in his mind, Jack starts to laugh very loudly in a very weird way. “I think he has lost his mind”, Doctor said looking at the Police officer. “There is nothing we can do about it now.”

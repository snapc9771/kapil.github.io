Ones there was a Supreme Power who is walking through a holy garden where galaxies shine from the water of the fountains with his Supreme Mate. The Supreme Mate asked the Supreme Power that tell me about one thing that you have done in your life that you found very amusing.
            
The Supreme Power turned toward the Supreme Mate and without even thinking for one second he said, Yes there is one thing that I found quite amusing and laugh at that sometimes when I am alone.
            
And what is it? The Supreme Mate asked.
You know one time I was just going through some of my old creations. Maybe just to find some peace. Then I suddenly came through this glowing swarm of incredible lights. They are just so beautiful to watch at the fade darkness of night. They are flying in the groups with so much love and coordination that even we lack here. This struck me so deeply that how does something this beautiful originate in my creation and how are they doing this. So much love and so much freely. 
            
Then I get to them and asked them that how they are living so happily in these huge amounts. 
            
But they ignored me and keep flying up over the petals of flowers and blue water of the ponds. This pissed me off so much that I made my mind to turn their never ending happiness into a never ending nightmare. 
            
I took all of them and then locked them inside a cage. And do you know what is the most interesting thing about that cage is? Supreme Power asked the Supreme Mate.
What is that my love? Supreme Mate asked.
            
In that cage they totally forget about who they really are and start thinking about the things that probably never going to benefit them. Another interesting thing is that they himself start fearing from leaving that cage so I donâ€™t have to make sure that they keep locked inside there. Anger, pain, hunger, sadness, cruelty and greediness start growing inside them.
            
What type of cage is that my love? I never heard about this type of horrific imprisonment before, Supreme Mate asked.
            
Body, this is what they call it. And those glowing lights, they are the souls. In those cages they are free to walk but yet they are trapped inside something that even the worst demons will fear, The Supreme Cage. And there is one more thing that amuses me.
            
They call and worship me as a God, who they think had made their lives better, said the God with a pityingly laugh as they are crossing the fountains of the universes.

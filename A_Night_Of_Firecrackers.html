[4 March, 2153]
I still remember the days when the desire to get to the stars born inside me. In childhood whenever I see at the night sky, I can only guess the number of possible worlds that exists there. At that time I felt myself like an atom in this ocean like universe.
            
Anyway today is my first step toward realising my dream. My name is Adam Taylor and I am a cosmonaut. A 5 member mission known as Talaash is launched today. Our mission is to reach to the planet known as AT-29A2 in Andormeda Galaxy. It is one and the only planet which we find habitable by looking through our powerful telescopes and the most important clue of an intelligent life there is the unrecognisable radio signals that we have received from time to time. It will take us approximately 4 years to reach at that planet.
            
Although with brightness in my eyes to reach towards my goal I have left behind a part of my heart. These are my wife Kristina and my two lovely children Steve and Bretta. Now we are going into hyper sleep for 4 years and will wake from it only when we will be very close to that planet.
            
            
[After 4 Years] 
[20 June, 2157]
Our crew just wake up from hyper sleep and if I frankly say it feels like it was just a few hours back when we get into hyper sleep. Now we are at a distance of 1 hour from the outer atmosphere of the planet. We have tried to communicate with them but it seems like they use a different kind of technology for communication purpose that is still unknown to us.
            
Now we are only few minutes away from their orbit and...... . What. Our spaceship is now detecting a huge number of obstacles in front of us. I think these are the artificial satellites launched by them. We haven’t expected that. Now if we can immediately stop our spaceship it still doesn’t save us from colliding with these satellites. So now it is in the God’s hand to save us. God please save us from this disaster. 
            
            
[After some unknown time]
My head is spinning right now. It feels like I just wake up from the worst eventualities. Yes now I remember. Our spaceship was completely destroyed due to the collision with the satellites. But now where am I. This place is really weird. Looks like a high-tech hospital. I think I am on the planet AT-29A2 right now. I don’t know why but seeing this place feels something like Déjà vu. I am alone in this room and laying on a bed. Now I have to get up to take a look at my situation.
            
On my right side there is big rectangular shaped machine. In front of me there is a black glass window. I can’t see through it but I can see my image in this glass. I just realise that I am still wearing my space suit. There is my big black helmet on my head. I think the atmosphere on this planet is not suitable for me and these people know that. But now I want to meet my other crew members and also want to meet the life form on this planet.
            
There is this button on the side of this glass window. I wonder what it......... Oh my God. On pressing this button I can see through it. There is 4 green coloured human like crappy faced aliens in the other room. There are the 4 members of my crew laying on tables in front of them. These monsters have ripped them apart. They are holding their brains and other body parts in their bloody hands. These aliens are nothing like what we have expected. These are the monsters which have killed my crew so inhumanly. Oh crap..... They saw me. They are screaming and saying something to me with their crappy face. But I am not able to hear them in this room. Now they are running towards me and I have no other option then to run. There is a door in right side of me which has a very different kind of unlock keypad. But what is this, my hands are automatically running on that keypad and suddenly the door is unlocked. 
            
Now I have to just run away from here. I don’t know where I am going but I am just running. These monsters are still chasing me. They have killed all of my crew and I think they only kept me alive so that they can torture me.
            
There came a number of doors in my way but I became successful in unlocking them. May be God is on my side today. Now I am standing in this room where there is huge number of nuclear weapons looking things. There is a voice inside me which is saying that I can blow this whole planet by setting up these weapons. 
            
Why did I hesitate from doing so? Those soulless creatures which have killed my all friends with such cruelty, they deserve to die. I don’t care about my life if I can kill them. Yes I will become there God and they all dies with my wish.
            
            
[After activating the Weapons]
Now there is no one who can save this planet. Only I can deactivate these weapons. They are approaching me. I can hear their steps. But no they cannot save their planet now. It’s time to move.
            
            
[After running – At the roof of that building] 
When they reach here it will going to be too late. Now I want to spend my last moments in peace. My friends will be proud of me. Now I just want to lay down and close my eyes.
But..... Wait a minute...... There is something I am remembering now. Am... Oh my God what have I done. No no no Aaaaaaaa.........
            
            
[What actually happened is that the space ship carrying the crew gets destroyed due to satellites and fell on the land. In this unfortunate accident 4 crew members dies at the spot. Only one crew member Adam Taylor has survived that and it was barely his mind that is working now. 
Then to know who these people are and where they came from, Adam Taylor is placed inside a machine which is just build to access the mind of the host with the help of another individual. The mind of Adam Taylor is connected with their army commander who has toughest mind among them to absorb the shock that can happen due to long accessing of mind with this new machine. They were not totally sure what this suit can do so they feels it right to enrobe him his space suit to give him the exact feeling of that cosmonaut. 
When this machine is switched on, the alien commander experienced his whole life in just few hours and in living this new life he forget who he really is. 
The big machine in his right side has the body of Adam Taylor in it. The humans whose bodies are seen by the commander were already dead when they arrive here. His alien friends are saying him exactly the same thing that who he really is. Because he belongs here that is why he knows all the passwords. Then his scared subconscious mind takes him at a place which is made to deal with emergency situations. Because he is an army commander so he knows exactly how to activate the weapons which are enough to destroy their whole planet.
And when at last the hangover of this new life starts to fade away from his mind, he realises who he really is and what he has done. When he removed his helmet, he has exactly the same crappy face which the other aliens have. But now it was too late. The whole city, the whole planet is exploding like bombs and like the firecrackers in Diwali. Huge buildings are coming down with loud explosions and between all this there is only one thing that commander screaming and that was_____ Aaaaaa..........]

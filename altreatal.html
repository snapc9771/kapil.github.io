Ordinary me and end of just another ordinary day. Going to take this bus from city to the small town where I live. Who am I? Well my name is Rayhan Arora. Most people call me Ray. It is 7 O’clock right now and everything is pretty dark out there. It has been one year since I have completed my B. Tech. from a private college and still now I have not been able to earn a penny. Today, I don’t remember exactly how many times but this may be my 100th time I got rejected from an interview. I got a miserable life and I am just nobody to this world.
            
As I was seeing outside through the window on this cold night as I always do, I didn’t realized that someone has just sat beside me. And of course it doesn’t matter who he or she is when on the other side I have lot of things to moan about.
            
But then I think I may well look at him. He/She may help me to spend some seconds of my never ending journey by looking and analyzing him.
            
When I looked at him, I think ‘Oh boy’. I knew that it’s been freezing at that time but that man seemed to be in a very serious health condition. Because he was wrapped in clothes from top to bottom. From black shoes to black jeans and black full sleeve t-shirt to his black hat. And this was not all. His neck was covered with a very thick muffler and face was covered by a black mask with some kind of white angel printed on it. Then at last his eyes are covered by specs. I mean I haven’t been able to saw a single hair on his body. Yeah this was something different from what I saw every day.
            
As I was looking at him, he turned his head towards me and looked at me the same way I was looking at him. I said nothing. I was just thinking that who is this old man. Then I realized that it’s my stop and so I got up. As I was passing that man, he suddenly grabbed my left arm with his left hand.
He said very quietly, “Do you believe in alternate realities?” It happened so quickly that I nodded my head in yes position. Well there was a time some years ago in college when I was into this kind of stuff, parallel universes and alternate realities. So I just said yes.
            
“Use it wisely.” This was the next thing he said to me. ‘What the hell’ this was what came into my mind after hearing that. I pulled my arm as quickly as I can from that psychos grip. Okay that was way weirder that a freaky stranger was asking me something like that. I ran in a hurry and leave that bus as soon as I can.
            
When I turned my head toward the bus, that stranger was still looking at me from the moving bus until it vanished from my sight. 
            
When I get home, this incident faded away from my memory after 3 or 4 hours. In winters I prefer to take a bath at night. So I was taking a bath at that time when I realized that my left arm is glowing from its lower side. There was a rectangle on my arm with a big 5 written in center of it. It scared the hell out of me. I checked my arm very carefully and realized that there was nothing inside my arm but somehow my skin was glowing like a mobile. It is not that it was glowing continuously but this thing appears only when I was thinking about it or thinking stress fully about other things. Then with some other hand movements I saw that it projects a hologram on my hand with two options Enter and Leave written in it.
            
The leave option was little fade which may be due to the reason that I haven’t entered anywhere. That was the time when I recall the incident with that freaky man. He just talked about alternate realities and to use it wisely. Is he talking about this? Is he really is the one who gave me this thing? There was only one way to check this, to touch that Enter icon. After having this thought, my heart starts beating very rapidly.
            
        </div>
        
        <div class="sub-heading"><h1>Chapter 2</h1></div>
        <div class="para">
            
When I touched the enter icon, I found myself standing on a building’s roof. It was scary because it was not my town but a very big city. Then I have to make sure that if it really is a parallel universe or this device just sent me somewhere on the planet.
            
It took me some time through stairs but I finally reached the ground floor. I left thunderstruck when I find that right now I am standing in a country named ‘Akaya’ where on my Earth ‘Japan’ exist. So this device really was a universal transporter. For that time it was enough. So I touched the Leave icon.
            
The next moment I was in my room standing right there where I have started. Before hopping there was a big 5 written on my arm so I thought now it must be reduced to 4. Because maybe I can jump only into 5 alternate realities. But as to my surprise 5 was still written on my arm. Maybe this indicates something else and so I can have more than 5 chances to travel into other universes. That placed a smile on my face.
            
The next thing that came into my mind was that if this device can be transferred to another person by holding hands like that man did. If this is true then I can use it more freely. To know about this, next day I went to see a movie with a girl that is my one and only friend from childhood. In between the movie when she was completely lost in the movie, I slightly hold her left hand into my left hand and when I pulled my hand back I saw a faint glow on her arm instead of mine. Then in a hurry I again grabbed her hand to take back control of that device and it came to me the same way.
            
So then I got to this conclusion that, This device was transferable but only one person can use it at one time. That was the rule number 1. As my life was nothing which is worst than a failure, I started thinking about making something out with the help of that device.
            
How can I make money and name from it? There were many ideas that came into my mind like taking an advanced technology from an alternate reality and sell here. But then I was not that smart to understand these kind technologies and selling those technologies without a strong back will put my life in danger from other competitive corporations. 
            
The next thought was to steal a precious thing like diamond or gold from other realities. But that was again has many dangerous outcomes like if a cop instantly shoots in my head before I can leave that reality and besides I am not good in stealing stuff.
            
I wanted the safest idea and the only option I found right was to carry a bestselling novel from the alternate realities to my universe. It had no risk because it is not illegal to carry a book and also I have this short time passion to write a novel which lost with time. 
            
So here was the idea. I take a bestselling novel. Publish here with my name as its author and boom. It will become a major novel in the history because it is already tested. Yes this will work I thought.
            
I chose the time of night to travel because dark was going to be on my side. Also I took my gold chain with me which is given to me by my mother on my 12th birthday. By selling its one small piece in Alternate reality, I will going to get enough money to buy a new book.
            
Then on arriving into the parallel universe second time, I get a little bit disappointed because this time I was also standing on the same building as before and it was the same Earth. So this device may send us only into one parallel universe.
            
But anyway I have to do what I came for. I sold a small gold piece to a shop and got some money. Then I get into a cafe. Ordered a coffee and borrow a laptop from a dude for some time. 
On internet I found the bestselling novel and it goes by the name of ‘The Reaver’. I didn’t bothered about the story because reading something in one of the most difficult and boring thing for me. But I promised myself that when I get back to home I will read it because at least I have to know the story before publishing it.
            
I purchased the book from the bookstore and when I reached a dark and lonely place, I touched the leave icon and next moment I was sitting on my bed comfortably.

        <div class="sub-heading"><h1>Chapter 3</h1></div>
        <div class="para">
            
I never felt so much happy in my life before. I was proudly thinking about my achievement. I thanked that Archangel who gave me this wonderful device so I can change my life for better.
But this happiness gets little interrupted when I saw a big 4 on my arm instead of 5. I said ‘Why?’ Why does it changed now? Is it because I have took something from that universe, if that was the case then I have to confirm it, but not today. I have to think about this through before doing something in hurry.
It was hard for me to spend an entire day in wait of jumping. At last when the darkness starts to spread outside, I touched the Enter.
            
This universal hopping kept me surprising because this time it was a new reality with a country named ‘Nirate’. But this time I was not into taking something. I spent exactly same time in this new universe as in my previous jump and then I returned home. I quickly gazed at my arm and it was still showing a big 4. So this settles it.
            
Here goes the rule number two. The device will not decrease its number until we take something from another reality into our universe. Previously I was thinking that if I became successful in bringing a bestselling novel, I first publish it and then after some time I will make the next jump to take the second novel. But now after using that device I get filled with this feeling of uneasiness that I don’t know if this device will realy going to be with me until its count decreases to zero or it is with me for a specific time. So then I made my mind to first collect all the novels and then to publish them one by one in my entire remaining life. So again I chose the next day for this purpose.
            
On next night at exactly 7 O’clock, I prepared to jump and I was super excited to see what kind of Earth this one gonna be.
            
But again on my 4th jump, I found myself on the same alternate reality as in my previous jump. I still don’t understand the working of that device. So may be it will sent me to a universe two times before choosing another.
            
But for now I have to concentrate on my goal. I went to sell another piece of my gold chain and then I get to the cafe to check about the bestselling novel of their which I will gonna grab latter. But today as I was doing all this, there was a intensive environment in there. I don’t know why but there were policemen spreaded almost everywhere.
            
People are constantly talking about something. They are distressed and everything in their seems so unstable.
            
But I kept doing my work. I found a bestselling novel by the name ‘Endowed Glory’. I gazed at its synopsis for only 2 seconds before I got distracted by the news on the LED in front of me. People are looking at it like their eyes are glued to it. The news was about someone that even they don’t have a clue about. Maybe he was a terrorist who is planning an attack on this country. As I was getting a little closer to the LED to know what was happening, I heard loud shouts of policemen out there and increasing sound of sirens. It scared me deeply as I was on this unknown Earth with God knows what disaster is going to happen in here. So instead of wasting any more time, I ran to the nearest book store and purchased that novel. When I came outside I saw the environment in there going more and more unstable and noisy. So I took no more time to touch leave.
            
Then there was a big difference in my that second and previous one. As one second ago where there is so much noise and tension around me, now it was all quite and safe in my warm room. My ears are still ringing from those loud noises.
            
I looked at my arm and as I was thinking now the number has decreased to 3 thanks to that small book in my hands. But man this thing was working on me like drugs. I have started to enjoy the thrill, adventure and excitement that came with the use of this device.
            
Now it was the right time to give this wonderful device a name. I chose the name Altreatal for it. It was a short form for Alternate reality portal.
            
Before going on my 5th trip on next day, I spent all night thinking about what can be happening on that Earth and Altreatal. Then this thought hit me that why I was thinking about taking a single novel all this time. If Altreatal gonna decrease its count every time I take something with me from another universe then why can’t I take 5, 10 or may be 20 novels with me at a time. It will provide me with so much content. So yes gluttony has no limits.
            
So I decided to take 2 novels next day because if it may decrease its count which will depend upon the number of things we are taking from other reality then I don’t want to use all my 3 chances in one attempt. So if it will decrease 2 numbers for taking 2 books, I will still be able to think about using my last chance with maximum efficiency. 
            
        </div>
        
        <div class="sub-heading"><h1>Chapter 4</h1></div>
        <div class="para">
            
Next day on my 5th hopping I came across another alternate Earth with a country named ‘Glowana’ where I was standing at that time. 
            
On that Earth there is also some kind of thing in the air. People here are also talking about something very excitedly. So when I opened the browser on the laptop to check out for bestselling novels in here, there was a burst of news pop ups from every corner of every website about a incident. So it was natural for me to read that so much talkative news.
            
After reading it I came to know that World’s richest man in this universe has been recently killed by someone and biggest investigating agencies in here are still not able to figure out one thing about how this would had happened.
            
First of all I found it natural for the people to talk about this so much because after all he was the richest man alive. But then after seeing his age which was 27 years, a dagger of thoughts passed through my mind. I got stunned because if what I was thinking is right then it will gonna change everything. But before thinking any further I have to make sure that what I was thinking is realy true. I closed the laptop and without thinking about bestselling I just run to the nearest bookstore to grab any books which can satisfy my thinking for that time. Because now it had become more than taking bestselling novels.
            
I came back to my Universe and immediately at about 10 O’clock I started reading my previous two taken novels. Now my arm is showing a 2. So the number of books will not affect its decrease in its count. It always gonna decrease one when we take one or more things from other universes.
            
Then going against my habit of not reading books, it took me approximately 4 hours to read those two novels very lightly from start to the end.
            
After reading those it became clear that what I was thinking was true. The last two alternate realities where countries Nirate and Glowana were present are the Earths where The Reaver and Endowed Glory took place.
            
On my 3rd and 4th trip when I was in the country Nirate, there was a lot of police and tension because of that thief in the news who is the main character in The Reaver and according to the story who stole precious national treasures around the world.
            
On the 5th trip I was on the Earth where country Glowana exist which is a country in the novel ‘Endowed Glory’. Endowed Glory is centered around the character named Peter Knightly who was the world’s richest man. So again that Earth was one where his story was taking place.
            
That put two things in my mind. First was that now I know that how this device changes the universes. So here goes the rule number 3. Whenever a book with a story is taken from an alternate reality, the next reality will going to be the same where settings are exactly same as the novel. After acquiring Altreatal, the first reality will going to be any random reality.
            
That was somewhat resolved the puzzle but the second thought gave me goosebumps. If a reality is chosen by the wearer of Altreatal, who has a book on life of the protagonist, then it may be possible that the man on the bus on that night may also have book of my life. Because if we can see that he gave me his device that most certainly make me its main character. He can know about my past, present and future. And as in the story ‘Endowed Glory’, the main character has a happy ending, then why he was get killed in between and the biggest question was who killed him?
            
These thoughts were enough to sent me in a coma because I was never been so haunted in my life from the fear of something unknown. Even my life was nothing still I have loved my life all along.
            
I suspected this some hours ago because I remembered that in the synopsis of second novel there was also a world’s richest man with the same 27 years age. So on the basis of these thinking I already planned to find out that if the murder of Peter Knightly is just an accident or there is something else for me to concern about.
            
        </div>
        
        <div class="sub-heading"><h1>Chapter 5</h1></div>
        <div class="para">
            
From last reality I have taken two novels in which the two main characters are highly popular. In one novel there is a world where the kings rule the Earth. It was a kind of story with prehistoric settings with some powers and fantasy in it. The protagonist of this story is the most powerful king on that Earth.
            
In other novel, it has a story in which the protagonist was again world’s richest man and also a powerful person. So next day when I was going to be in the alternate reality, it becomes very easy for me to keep an eye on these characters because if anything happens to them I will know it. But only thing that I was having thoughts about at that time was that which reality it is going to be from those two stories.
            
Next day I packed my backpack with all the necessary things mostly food which I will gonna carry with me on my next reality at 7 O’clock. Because this time I was planning to stay there for a while, to see everything goes smoothly with those main characters so that I will be convinced that everything is fine. After that I have other things to think about.
            
So finally when I arrived at this new universe, I get stunned to see those huge buildings and infrastructure. Here technology was so advanced that for a second I thought that I came into the future. But this reality was not the one in which there is that rich man but it was totally different from what I was expecting.
            
Here the protagonist was the world’s richest man who has biggest technological cooperation in that world and who is the king of the biggest empire in there because although they are highly technological advanced but they still living like old times. So yes that reality was a hybrid of those two novels. Here one protagonist has a life which is the combination of life of those two main characters. Here place of magic is taken by highly advanced technology. However I was not able to differentiate between their technology or a magic on my Earth.
            
If the Altreatal wearer will took 2 or more books from the alternate reality or if a book has more than one story in it then the next reality will gonna be a hybrid of those with only one protagonist if physically possible. That was the rule number 4.
            
It took me only 2 hours to grab all this information because cell phone like gadgets called Mite are scattered there everywhere. There everything was free. From technology to food, everything was free of cost. This is because they have utilized the power resources that we can’t even think about. These Mite and their vehicles consume nuclear energy which is sufficient to run these things for trillions of years and to run their bigger resources like food making plant, they utilizes half part of the sun as a power resource. They have controlled there population from thousands of years to a constant level. So because of these things they have reached a state where they can eat all their life for doing nothing but of course they do work because this is what separates us from dead.
            
It was obvious that I haven’t grabbed Mite from their shops because here everyone was registered and if I do that I will gonna be in a big trouble. So I found it on a bench as I have already said it that technology is scattered here everywhere.
            
I think people here left there devices wherever they want and at morning robots will collect those devices and people will get new ones at their homes. No one is rich no one is poor to show off their high priced branded goods and long bills. What a luxurious life and what a right way to live.
            
I was constantly in touch with that what was happening to the king and so I chose to take a nice night walk around that place while I was there. Here not only the technology which was magical but here nature was also at its maximum charm. Human and nature exist alongside in there. At about 2 a.m., I chose a bench on a beautiful park with open sky to take a nap. This place was better than the luxurious rooms of the five star hotels on my Earth.
            
Next day I woke up early at about 7 O’clock and then I have a nice cup of hot Chocó coffee I managed to by for me by a child. 
I came across the news that today King will gonna give a speech about something that I think will be a main part of the story on a place where thousands of people will gather and it will gonna be broadcast everywhere around the world.
            
I was walking at that time when the speech started at 9 O’clock. Then I start listening it on the same place with a big screen on a building, joining the crowd in front of it.
            
King was warning his people about someone who have infected their technology and going to use it against them.
            
I think he was talking about the villains of those stories. Everyone is looking at the screen very keenly when suddenly energy blasts starts bursting from behind the king and his guards gets blown like popcorn. King turned back with the speed of light and starts defending himself from that armed man. King was very good with his fighting skills but that person seemed much more quick. In front of all the people and the cameras, he grabbed his neck into his arm and pierced a big dagger into his heart through his back. Then he twisted that dagger to completely rip off his heart so that no technology can save him.
As other guards proceeded in a hurry to capture him he vanished into thin air.
            
After that there was army everywhere. There king was dead. People were crying, shouting and blaming that unknown murderer which they think is the one whom their king is talking about. But I knew the truth, who that person realy was. As army forces were started to surround every place, I chose to leave that place right now.
            
        </div>
        
        
        <div class="sub-heading"><h1>Chapter 6</h1></div>
        <div class="para">
            
After this incident I sat on my bed for many hours in the dark with door and windows all are closed. As I saw him on the screen, although his face was hidden, he was the same person who gave me Altreatal. He is the the one who has killed the King, Peter Knightly and most certainly the thief also. He has killed all those protagonists whose novels I have taken.
            
Why is he doing this? And how does he travelling into other realities when he has already given his Altreatal to me. Does he have more then one of these? Or is he is the creator of Altreatal?
            
No he can’t be. Because if he has invented this, then he don’t need me to conduct all these killings. But why does he need me.
            
Yes maybe he has somehow manipulating that 5 times rule to travel into more than 5 alternate realities. Another thing that I was thinking about is that how does he knew about the fact that who is the protagonist in the alternate reality. Because only thing that can tell him about that was the novels themselves but I have always protected those novels in a very protective safe with a lock combination of 9 digits. I was sure that he didn’t knew about main characters from my novels.

He came into my universe and then everything he has done was unknowingly connected to me. That means only one thing that he has a book in which my life is written as a story. And if I am its protagonist, after using me two more times when Altretal’s count decrease to zero, he will most certainly also going to kill me.
            
If he knew everything about me, if he knew what I am going to think and do, then no doubt I will be dead no matter what I will do. Before this my life was nothing and when I think it has some meaning, I came to know that I was just a puppet whose strings are in someone else hands.
            
But no. I have beared a lot. If he will going to kill me then he better prepared to run a little. I am not dying that easily. I have to think something which can give me at least a little advantage against him. What will happen if I take a novel in which there is some kind of hi-tech weapon. Then I steel it and use against that Dark Archangel.
            
But then on the other thought why can’t he hasn’t stolen a device which can give him unlimited opportunity to travel in other realities at first place. Because in every reality there should be a number of stories on alternate realities. Then he only has to pick one such book and then he can get the device in following reality because he himself can use Altreatal 5 times which will be enough for this purpose. So why does he going through all this trouble.
            
Then a reason came into my mind and I quickly grabbed my bag from my side. On opening it I couldn’t find the Mite and other eatable things that I have took when I was in that reality.
I was 101% sure that I have everything in my bag when I was listening King’s speech. If it isn’t there then it has cleared some of my doubts.
            
Here is some modification in rule number 2. Altreatal will not decrease its number until we will take one or more books from alternate reality. And here goes the rule number 5. Altreatal wearer can not take anything from alternate reality except books.
            
Then this settles the fact that why that person hasn’t used another device to travel. Then there was one more thing. If we can’t bring an Altreatal like device in previous reality then why he hasn’t used that in the same reality where he will found that device. It was not that he hasn’t think about that. He is very intelligent that I know for sure. So there must be some other reason but I will found it out later. Before that there is a bigger thing that bothering me.
            
If taking a book with story is the only thing that can run Altreatal then it seems highly lucky for that man to find me who in billion of trillions of ideas chose only one idea which included novels. How does he did this. Yes he has done this because he has already story of my life. This makes my belief stronger that he has a book of my life.
            
So now I have to think about something that can help me figure out something out of the box. Then because I don’t know much about that murderer, I thought that I can use the stories of the novels that have created that hybrid reality.
            
        </div>
        
        <div class="sub-heading"><h1>Chapter 7</h1></div>
        <div class="para">
            
Then I started reading those two last novels very carefully. I figured out that the villain in the novel with king was a girl who admired the young and handsome king but turned against him when he ditched her. But at last king realized his mistake and they both lived together. It was some kind of a story for Children and love birds whereas in the novel with rich man, the villain as we found out in the last was also a girl but she was not really in love with the protagonist. But wants him to realize that even the common people will have what it takes to run these types of big corporations. So this was a kind of competitive story.
            
If the protagonist from two novels was a combination in hybrid reality, then may be the villain also goes the same way. If that was the case then it is certain that villain would going to be a girl. Her age should be 20 or 21.
            
Now in those 2 stories, even if there was a villain, they never tried to kill or harm the main character in any way. The king's villain has even tried to save him at a point. So the girl I am looking for have no intention to harm the rich king but if somebody other then her has already killed the king then I think she would be pretty pissed off right now.
            
So if I found that girl I most certainly will get a friend who has a great knowledge of technology. If I combine the characteristics of her like she was a nerd, she always loved technology, at some point she also loved the king, if king ditched her then they have in contact at some point, she lives alone because she has no family, always ahead of everyone in class....... with the power of their technology that anyone can know everything about anyone, then I doubt it would be difficult for me to find that girl with so many extraordinary characteristics.
            
Than with a plan I again jumped into that reality at 7 O'clock of the same day. Of course people in there are sad and their pace was slow due to the loss of their king. But my pace has increased. I searched on their internet about the girls with those characteristics. There are long lists but with cross elimination with each other, there is only one name left.
            
Haven, that was her name. She was not far from there and I have to find her. It took me some time to reach at her Location. On arriving at first I doubted that someone specially a girl will live here, far from city at the edge of the jungle. And she didn’t even answer me from inside that house when I was standing at her door. But when I mentioned the king, the door opened after some seconds. I walked inside the house. It was not big and not a single light has been on. Stumbling upon some objects I reached a room at the end of the house.
            
Moonlight is coming through big windows in the front. There are wires and disassembled electronic parts laying on tables. There was a girl sitting on a chair in between me and windows with her face toward windows.
            
She was weirdly upset about what has happened because a character has just lost her reason to exist. It took me some time but I told her everything that I knew, the whole truth.
I told her everything because there is something about that girl that made me trust her and yes she was very beautiful. That was also a reason.
            
She asked me that what she can do for me. She was extraordinary with technology so I gave her Altreatal and told her to try everything that can somehow change its working so that I can figure out ways to use it outside its rules. That was the only thing that can benefit me at that time because its rules are the things that were behaving as shackles for me.
            
After working on it for one whole day she told me that this device is impossible to alter. This is made with a technology that even surpasses there. It almost looked like it was made by the God himself because it uses and behaves according to the tiniest fraction of the atom of the DNA of a human body.
She said that she can’t change its working but there was one thing she can do.
            
She told me that she can tempor with one of its functioning to temporarily sent me to the reality which this device has experienced just before entering my reality. This will going to be a temporary jump and I can last there for only few minutes.
I thought I can work with that because as I have realized that whenever I entered a new reality, the time at which I arrive there is not exactly the beginning of the story. I always traveled a little bit ahead from the beginning. So in other words I have virtually traveled into the future. That was the rule number 6. 
            
So if the working of Altrealtal is reversed like we were doing at that time, this means I can travel back into time a little bit before the time when the slayer made his jump into my reality. Because the time at which murderer leave that reality may be the ending of a virtual story of that reality. That was the time when the slayer will have book of my life and maybe somehow I can take it or at least have a glimpse of its plot.

Because until and unless I read book of my life, I can not change anything. No matter what I will do, it ultimately already written into the book which that slayer can use against me.
But it was certain that if I read it then I can change whatever the ending written into it against me because it has been already proved by that murderer that a story can be changed by someone who has already read the story.
            
Then with little preparation she transported me into the reality in which story of my life was written. Again I found myself on the roof of a building. It was dark and I thought I have traveled back may be a day in time from the point when he enters my reality.
            
But I got surprised because someone was looking right at me from a distance. He came closer to me so I can see his face and now I got double surprised. Because he was me. He was my alternate version but with glasses. It was very weird to see myself like this.
            
But he looked in a hurry. He told me that he got late to arrive at the conclusion of books and stories. But now he had managed to read the book with which the slayer will gonna enter into my reality and this was the reason that he knew that I will gonna be here. He said that now it is too late for him to save himself but I can save myself.
            
He said that there are many things that I don’t know, but now there is no time to talk. Then quickly I asked him that where is ‘the book’ now? He said that he had burnt it so that the murderer can’t figure out that what is going to be the end of the story and so I can change it to save myself.
            
This doesn’t make any sense to me that why he has the book of my life before the murderer and why he is my alternate version and what is all this he was talking about.
            
Then he came close to me, be grabbed my shoulders and said that I have to return now. He said he will help me. But how? He didn’t tell. He said that the murderer is now coming and murderer is going to kill him. So now he has to run downstairs so that he can’t see me.
            
After saying this he opened the door to downstairs and run down as quickly as he can. I stayed there almost for a minute to figure out what is happening in here. Then I also run down so maybe I can save him if what he was saying about the killer was true. But in darkness I got very close to the killer before I can stop. He was wearing the same dress and holding in his hands the dead body of my alternate version. He already killed him. Then the killer turned towards me and he looked at me very carefully. I think he figured it out that who I am and where I came from.
            
“Your time hasn’t came yet”, he said while I constantly staring into his eyes. He just stayed there for few seconds. He hasn’t done anything to me and then I bounced back to the Rich king reality.
            
I was in shock from what has happened and then Haven told me that the police has figured it out that the murderer came from else where and so because I also came from the same place, they think that I was the killer and now they know that I was there. So she told me to hurry or else I will going to be in very big trouble.
            
I don’t know how I got this courage but I hold her hands and said that we will meet again somehow. Than we talked about few other things. She was watching me when I ran from there. I have some thoughts in my mind to meet her and so then I decided to grab a book as soon as possible because I knew for sure that if I visit here next time, they will be ready to take me down.
            
So then I ran to the bookstore in the city. But when I entered the shop I just stopped like a bullet in the viscous fluid. The feeling that there were countless numbers of realities around me represented by those books was breathtaking. I just have to choose one that I can use as a weapon and that’s it. There was so many stories, so many wonders. What will happen if I will take a magic novel and then obtain some powers somehow to kill anyone instantly. Will it work? Thoughts and possibilities are forming and evolving in my mind when suddenly the whole bookstore blew up.
            
That blast was so big that it literally broke every single wood block from which that bookstore is made up of. Surprisingly I just got little scratches. With ringing ears and from all that dust in front of my eyes I can see the soldiers closing on me.
From that blast books are scattered everywhere around me. So I reached my hand to grab whatever I can. Before they can zap me, I leaved that reality.

        <div class="sub-heading"><h1>Chapter 8</h1></div>
        <div class="para">
            
I was completely tired. Worn off from everything that has happened to me. But at last I was in my room. I took a deep breath. I sat on the floor with my back leaned to the wall. It was dark in my room, door and all the windows were closed. I thought I have opened them before leaving. Or maybe I haven’t. My head was not at right place at that time.
            
I stood up to slide the curtains. I just have removed one curtain when I saw someone seating right over my bed. The little light coming from the window was enough for me to knew that who he was.
            
It was the murderer. He was looking at me very patiently. He frightened me so much that I pushed myself on the window so maybe it can open and I will leave this room as soon as possible and ducked my head a little bit in case he is ready to shoot me. But he just stayed there.
            
“Although he burnt the book of this reality, I knew when you will gonna jump into the past”, he said. Yes I was thinking about that at that time.
            
“I saw the count on your arm”, he said. Of course he can knew with this. Then with some courage I asked him that how does he knew that I will choose to take the novels after book of my life has already been burnt.
            
“Well well”, he said. “Why do you think that that book was book of 'Your' life?”
“Because you know that I will be the person who will gonna take novels to change my life.”
“Okay. You don’t think much”, he said. “I am a little disappointed. There are many other reasons I can know that but you will get them only if you think and besides there is one more reason for that.”
After that he stopped for a second. “Okay I will give you a hint”, he said. “I know what you call this device”, he pointed toward my arm. “Altreatal, this is what you call it. I knew it even you haven’t even spoken this word and this is only in your mind.”
I didn’t get it. “So you can read mind”, I said.
            
“Oh you fool”, he said very disappointed from me. Then he came to the corner of the bed in front of me and removed his mask and specs. His white face was looked like ice cubes in that light. I didn’t know that I looked like this. Yes that murderer was also one of my alternate version but a little taller than me.
I shivered after seeing him. How can someone got that much heart to kill his own selfs. Then he got a little away from me to where he was sitting before.
            
“I was convinced about the fact that you will take novels because you are me. Our alternate versions, we all are same and no matter if it is a different reality, we all ends up taking books at last. Because I am you that is why it was easy for me to come in here when you are not in your room and open that safe where you hide your novels. Yes I can think of every password or combination that you can think about”, he said. “Okay take out your new novel from the bag and read its synopsis.”
            
He knew that I have taken a novel because a decrease in my count. “Go on take it out”, he said again. Then I pulled out the novel. From its cover it looked mysterious and its name was Carnage. Then I opened it and started reading its synopsis. The main character in the novel, I can relate him with someone but not me.
            
“This novel is about you”, I said. “Yes this is correct”, he replied. “This is the novel I am going to use for my next reality and it all starts over again but with different stories and targets.”
            
“Then the previous book is it also……” I asked him while already knowing the possible answer.
“Yes”, he said. “That book was also book of 'my life’. And now give it to me, thank you”. He said after he snatched the book from me with a yo yo like thing.
            
“Don’t you think it will be convenient for me to go on with a book of my life instead of yours. It tells me so much and almost everything that I have to do.”
            
Then I didn’t said anything for some seconds because this thing was just beyond my comprehension that how come he made me bring out that novel when it happened so accidentally and I took it as my choice. How he made me do it and why there is a novel like that in that reality at first place. I didn’t realized it earlier but he is manipulating me on a very big level.
            
What is this pattern he is following and how he is doing it. Why he is Killing all the protagonists and why he killed my alternate version if he was not the main character. I can’t bear these maddening questions anymore.
            
“No matter what kind of reality it is, we all are same”, he said. “We all are cursed with this ability to find out more and more about Altreatal. No matter if we have failed in our studies, work and life. Now and then I came across with our versions who ‘like you’ try to manipulate the device to kill me but you can’t match my mind.”
            
“I have arrived at a stage where I can choose what will happen to me in future thanks to Altreatal.”
There is no way he can do that, I thought with considering every possibility of happening that.
            
“Okay I confess that you are a little smarter than others because you have figured out a lot about Altreatal with one chance still left to jump. You are going to be an interesting pray. So why don’t you will gain some more inside knowledge and then try to defeat me.”
            
After saying it he grinned at me. He is smiling on my incapability. I want to punch him so hard on his face that not a single tooth left in his mouth. He was directly challenging me.
“So here is some inside knowledge”, he said. “As I suspect that you already know that if we transfer this device to anyone, he get Altreatal but we left with no device. But here is a twist.
            
If we give Altreatal to a version of ourselves then he got a copy of Altreatal with a full 5 chances and we still retain the original. Once you will use Altreatal, then your count can not be increased by any way like even if you receive Altreatal one more time from another person, your count remain same.”
“You know how I got it”, he said coming a little closer to me.

“Someone gave it to me like I gave you. But he was not a killer and I didn’t get any news about him after that. I also used Altreatal to take novels and make my life batter.
            
I realized this novel-reality relation after two jumps. So when only two count left on my arm I started to worry about losing this supremely precious creation of God. But then a miracle happened. Although it has a negligible probability of happening, but in my 4th reality I came across a novel with a protagonist who is our alternate version. His story was very pathetic and have a tragic ending like our real life.
            
So I decided to pass Altreatal to our alternate version so that he can also make his life somewhat better. I was very kind and normal at that time.” He said lost in his thoughts.
            
Then I get to his reality and gave him the device and told him everything that I knew. He thanked me a lot for that.
            
Then I was thinking about the fact that now I have to live here for my entire life because now I don’t have the Altreatal to leave. But then I was shocked to see that I still have the device. It was a relief and now I found a new feature in it. It was a feature in which I can write some things. It has its own rules of working but it can be used to write additional settings about the reality whose novel we currently have. It doesn’t matter if it is written in the novel or not but if we write some additional settings about the newly unlocked reality in it, it will happen in that reality. But there was a catch that I can use this feature only for one time.
            
You know Altreatal and its copy that I gave to you all, although has different count according to the fact that if a person is new to it or not, they are highly correlated with each other. Here is one more thing. If I write an additional setting about reality and don’t jump myself, then my alternate version who has its copy, who make a jump in this new edited reality prior to me will experience its effect and goes into the reality with my additional settings.
            
Now what this will do is that I still retain that feature, but it decreases my alternate version's feature to enter into a reality with edited settings and not mine. Further if I write about a reality in which a character with my alternate version's characteristics will enter then I can manipulate him to do anything that I want. As I can also use this feature for only once on my one alternate version but it can be used as many times as I want if alternate versions are different.
            
So when only one count left in my alternate version's Altreatal, I write a setting in which my alternate version enter the reality and took a book in which there is my next alternate version who will took different novels until at last I manipulate him to take a novel with exactly same settings but different novels and it goes on repeatedly. I write in every setting that I will win at last no matter if my alternate version is dead or not, who is always dead.
            
You can’t defeat me even if you do anything because I have written your destiny like this. This feature this power completely changed me and opened a new door of possibilities. A feature that can give us the power to design our future. This feature will only unlock when we give Altreatal to one of our AV.”
            
“But why do you kill the protagonist”, I asked him.
“Yes this is indeed a good question”, he replied. “The moment you got this power to change and modify your destiny then there is nothing I mean nothing that can satisfy our increased hunger to now do something great. Diamonds and money appears like stones and tissue papers when you reach this level.
            
With those infinite realities you saw the other worlds as just a video game in which nothing happens if you kill anyone. And at this stage I find killing and hunting is the only thing that can amaze me a little bit. Also I have seen all these heroes in movies and books as frauds because life is not like that. So I decided to give them a taste of failure. Believe me it really is fun.
            
Now as you know that the book which transported me into your reality which our AV( Alternate Version) has burnt is not book of your life. So you were not the main character at that time. But when you were in your previous reality, I wrote the setting so that you will take this book which I took from you and that makes you the main character now. So now it’s your turn.
            
But don’t worry. I found you a little smarter and that now you have all this knowledge, so I am letting you run for now. That is why I have left you with one count remaining. I want some entertainment which I hope you can provide me with.
            
But remember this. The next time I see you which may be in between or at last in my next journey, I will kill you. And next time I also want to know that how you traveled into previous reality.”
            
After saying this he vanished from my bed by entering into the next reality in which there will gonna be our next AV with different stories and protagonists which he will gonna hunt.
            
        </div>
        
        <div class="sub-heading"><h1>Chapter 9</h1></div>
        <div class="para">
            
Now I can remain in my reality, hiding from the killer but this doesn’t benefit me. I also have to jump into the battle ground. With these thoughts I also jumped into the new reality. All of our devices are connected, originating from a single Altreatal, so we all can jump where one jumps.
            
In this new reality our AV has a completely changed life. He was very rich, have cars, friends and girlfriends but at last he also chooses to use Altreatal to take novels. Already having all these things but still taking novels, maybe he is hungry for name and fame. He was right at last we all are same.
            
Now the obvious thought that anyone can get at that time was that I will meet my new AV somehow and give him my Altreatal so that I can also get the writing feature but this is what killer AV is hoping me to do right now. If I go near that new AV, killer AV will gonna be around him and necessarily looking for me. If he saw me, he will kill me instantly because he has already said so. Moreover I have something in my mind that require me to make a move only until at last when our new AV will take the 5th novel which contain the beginning of the new massacre.
            
Until then I have to focus only on hiding myself because my future greatly depend on it. When the killer AV already killed two of the protagonists, I got a friend who is willing to help me in stopping the killer from killing the main characters. That friend whom for now I call The Guardian. Guardian became successful in stopping the 3rd and 4th protagonist’s murder and then our new AV unknowing all these happening, took out the 5th and last novel which will begin this all over.
            
But like I said I have a plan at the end which includes the steeling of the 5th novel from new AV before it gets into the hands of the killer.
            
Guardian was so effective that the last novel gets into my hands just before getting in the hands of AV killer. The novel has a red cover like blood red.
            
But before I can even open it something happened. Somehow he found out that I am working with the Guardian. So on a national channel which was owned by our new AV, he used the new AV to blackmail me that either I will bring the novel to him or the new AV will gonna kill his parents. And so Killer was manipulating our new AV even out of the alternate reality. This means that Altreatal can be used to continuously manipulate a character even out of the alternate reality.
            
It was a smart move because he knew that I will not come out for anyone. I don’t care if he kills anyone in these realities because for me my safety is first. But looking those parents even if they were alternate versions of my parents, I can never let them die.
            
So I get to the place where they are keeping alternate parents with the red novel with me. It was the time of night and he is holding a gun on alternate parents head in a ground which is surrounded by the police because he has announced this on national television. But it doesn’t bothered him because he knew that one’s he will get the novel, he will kill me and our new AV and jump into the new reality where no one can touch him. New AV is standing at distance from him, his mind completely controlled by the killer.
            
Killer was very happy to see me there. He gave our new AV a phone to click the picture of the synopsis of the novel so that he will be sure that it is the same novel. He exactly did that and then after reading it he nodded his head that this is the right book.
            
Then he told me to give him the novel and he will release our alternate parents. I told him to first release them and then I will give him the novel. So he released them and when they get to a distance from him, he again threw that yo yo like thing towards me. But I dodge that and run from there with the novel in my hands. He shouted at me to stop but I ran from there like a bullet. He immediately starts running after me without thinking about parents as I was hopping.
            
I ran from over the police cars and following me he also did so shooting some police officers in his way. I ran as fast as I can but I can see him catching on me. So I entered into a building and used a lift to leave him behind. I get to the roof but after that there was nowhere to go.
            
As I was standing on the edge of the building, he came from behind me gasping and laughing very loudly.
            
“Oh you gave me a good chase”, he said. “I am happy that you gave me at least some entertainment. But now it’s over. Give me the book.”
I didn’t said anything. I was just looking at him.
“But before you die, I want to ask you about that unknown person who stopped me from killing those characters and took this novel from my hands.”
“I can tell you that but only if I was going to die”, I said. “Don’t you think I have other ways to escape.”
After saying so I quickly pressed the Enter Icon on my arm to enter into the new reality which is unlocked by this novel. I got transported in the mid of a road. From where I again started running as fast as I can because he will gonna be here any second. I ran for a long distance and when I turned around to look back, I saw him standing right there where I and then he were transported. He was very relaxed and standing there patiently. It was very weird that now he is not trying to catch me and also a little scary.
            
Then I get this feeling of something odd about that place. I stopped and looked around me. All the people in there are looking at me with their blue lightning eyes. They were not proper humans but are half human and half robots. They were cyborgs.
            
In a couple of seconds they stopped whatever they were doing, stopped their vehicles, tear apart their newspapers that they were reading and they all start chasing me like zombies.
I was scared. It seems like they forget about themselves and now only wants me like some mindless creatures. They were coming from everywhere and I cannot escape all of them. Then before I can do anything they grabbed my arms and hold me there until he slowly came there.
            
“Trying to run haan”, he said. “I was already prepared if something like this happens. Pity that you chose to enter in this reality instead of leaving from previous reality. Because I also wrote this detail in the Altreatal that this time the reality in which our new AV exist will going to be a cyborg reality so that I can control them with my mind with the help of this chip I got from one of the reality. It doesn’t matter that how it worked because I have already written it. I wrote about this kind of reality so that in case you or more precisely your that servant new friend tries to do something in this reality. I found this idea very interesting because now I can also control the new AV with my mind to do whatever I want but only this time. I haven’t wrote this much in the past and nor gonna write something like this in future because it ruin all of my entertainment. Writing everything that is going to happen is so boring. There should be some unknown events happening around.”
I didn’t think that he will think and plan this much. He has really started to take every precaution and now he became more dangerous. But I also have taken every precaution. Until now everything is going as I have planned. So I started laughing as much freely as I can.
            
“Did you lose your mind mate”, he said.
“No it is because everything has happened as we planned”, I said.
“What are you talking about”, he asked. “Taking you here, away from the previous reality is what we have planned to do from the beginning” I said. “My friend whom you are calling as my servant is not the one who you think. He is much more powerful than me and you. He came from a place which is beyond these realities and our imagination. You can call him as a God who came here to prevent you from messing around with space and time.
“Bullshit. You are bluffing”, he said in a hope that what I am saying is not true.
            
“Yes I am”, But I laughed after saying. I know that this laugh will gonna touch him deeply.
            
“Well then if it is true, you are going to take me to him”, he said and snatched the novel from my hand. But I insisted that I don’t want to go not anywhere. Then because he was angry that someone powerful then him came in and I am enjoying it, He start hitting me very hard. He smashed my ribs with his powerful punches and he punched my face until my one eye was unable to see because of swelling of my face.
            
“Let’s see what your God is made up of”, he said. Then he forced me to leave that reality and I found myself back on the roof of the building. Then he came there but in that little time interval I get a little away from him by crawling and sat there with my back resting upon a cemented railing. The pain in my ribs is killing me and I was holding my stomach with my hand so it hurt less.
            
“Tell me, where is your God”, he said. As he was going said another word, the novel fell from his hands and he also bent down with his hands and knees on the ground. He started trembling. All of his body was shaking.
            
“What is happening to me?”, he asked. “What did you do?”
After hearing those golden words that my ears wants to hear so badly, I grinned at him the same way he is smiling at me back when I am just a puppet to him.
“See the count on your arm”, I said. “It decreased to zero.”

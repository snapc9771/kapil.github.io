“I.G. can you tell your fans the reason you came here.” Asked one of the reporter following Ivan and other reporters also asked the same thing.
            
“I already told you guys it’s nothing.” Said Ivan as he entered into the psychiatrist clinic. Then the door closed behind him while he was surrounded by a group of bodyguards.
            
“You can stay here.” Said Ivan to his guards and he entered into the room of Dr. Bill Hugertz, one of the world’s best psychiatrist.
“Come my friend.” Said Dr. Hugertz as they both shook their hands. “Please sit.”
            
Ivan took a glass of water and drank it at ones.
“So Ivan what’s it.” Asked Dr. Hugertz.
“Nothing big.” Said Ivan and gave a big sigh. “It’s just something happening to me now a day. Don’t know if it is anything to concern about.”
            
“Well you can tell me and then get expert’s advice.” Said Dr. Hugertz.
“It’s more of a kind of hallucination.” Explained Ivan. “Now a day I am seeing this 'thing', okay. I don’t know exactly what it is. Sometimes it looks animated and some time it is live. Sometimes it is a bunny and sometimes it becomes the Ice cream logo printed on the ice cream vending machines. It’s almost different every time.”
“Okay tell me in detail about it.” Said Dr. Hugertz. “Did it do something or tries to speak to you?” 
“Yes. No matter in what form it is but it acts almost like a living thing.” Said Ivan nervously scratching the sofa. “And it speaks to me.”
            
“Yes go on.” Said Dr. Hugertz. “Tell me about the things it commonly says to you and how does it express them.”
“I don’t know but it seems to be feeling very sorry for me.” Said Ivan. “It always seems to be sympathizing with me. Like my life is nothing but a sad tragedy.”
“And do…” Asked Dr. Hugertz squishing his eyebrows. “Do you think about your life in the same way?”
“No. Never.” Said Ivan backing up a little on his sofa. “Why would I feel sorry about my life when I can buy this whole city with five others.”
            
“You are damn right about that.” Agreed Dr. Hugertz. “Ivan Grace, top pop singer in the world. You got all this while you are only 17 years old. You got a terrific career, richest family, one of the top models is your girlfriend and this world filled with your crazy fans. Every person on this planet dreams to have a life like yours and that is why my question is unreasonable.”
            
“There is no way I can think about my life like this even in my subconscious mind.” Said Ivan. “Maybe it is a ghost or something.”
“Oh please don’t talk about these things in front of me. For your condition there must be a perfect explanation.” Assured Dr. Hugertz. “So what does it exactly says to you.”
            
Ivan stood up from his sofa and walked close to the window. “It says that it can make my life better, like a dream.” Continued Ivan. “It says that it just need my permission to do so and then it will lift my life from ground to the skies, make it like heaven.”
“And do you give him the permission?” Asked Dr. Hugertz.
“Hell no.” Said Ivan. “I don’t need a filthy hallucinated creature to make my life better than it already is. My life is better than its so called heaven.”
            
“Okay that’s good.” Appreciated Dr. Hugertz. “You should not accept its terms and conditions. Because in most cases ones a patient starts to negotiate with his hallucinations, they only kept growing more and more until the patient got mad and it become impossible for him to return to his normal life.”
            
“I can assure you doctor, it isn’t going to happen with me.” Said Ivan confidentially. “I may well show him the huge crowds gathered into the stadiums to see my performance and people spreading their arms in my paths. Then it will realize for whom it is feeling so sorry.”
“Hmm.” Said Dr. Hugertz . “So do you call it with some reference or some kind of name.”
            
“Not until now.” Said Ivan. “But now I have a name for it in my mind.”
“And what is it?” Asked Dr. Hugertz.
“Bug.” Said Ivan. “This is what I am going to call it.”
“ Bug?” Questioned Dr. Hugertz.
“Yes.” Said Ivan. “Like a bug in computers or applications. It appeared in my life like a bug. Trying to interfere with my successful journey of life.”
            
After saying it as he turned toward Dr. Hugertz, he suddenly stopped and shrank over his place.
“Is there something wrong Ivan?” Asked Dr. Hugertz.
“Can you see it over the table?” Ivan pointed toward the table at some distance from the doctor. “In the shape of a calendar.”
“Is it there?” Asked Dr. Hugertz. “Is the 'bug' there?” And then Dr. Hugertz jumped from his sofa and walked up to the table.
“And now it is gone.” Said Ivan. “Sometimes it disappears when someone approaches it with curiosity. It happened with my manager too. It seems to respond to you people even if you can’t see it.”
“Don’t worry Ivan.” Said Dr. Hugertz. “We will going to hunt down your hallucinations.”
            
“Next time doc.” Said Ivan as he looked toward his watch. “Right now I have to run for another show. You know people can’t survive without listening to my voice.”
            
“Yeah next time champ.”Said Dr. Hugertz. “Until than I will look into your case and definitely find some solution.”
And then in a moment he was in his car with his manager going toward his another performance.
            
“So how does it go with the doctor?” Asked his manager, Mini Williams.
“It was alright.” Said Ivan. “Questions and answers.
“Hey Mini.” Continued Ivan. “Do you think I have to feel sorry about…. My life in any way.”
            
“What? No.” Said Mini. “You are the greatest singer that this world has ever known. Why you should feel sorry about your life.”
“Yeah I totally agree with you.” Said Ivan as his car slowly stopped. “What happened Ornet?” Asked Ivan.
“I just checked. Someone got hit by a car ahead.” Replied Ornet. “A beggar actually. They are saying he ran onto the middle of the road when someone threw some eatables from their car, probably to grab something delicious.”
            
“Is he dead?” Asked Ivan.
“Probably. Can’t say for sure.” Said Ornet. “But he was hit pretty bad.”
            
“I hope he would be dead.” Babbled Ivan. “These pathetic slums. Why can’t the government make some kind of rule to eliminate these slums?” Taunted Ivan. “I mean from the dawn of humanity, there is no way in this universe through which everyone can be made equal. So what is the reason to let them live and pollute our society? They do nothing for the growth of our world. They are not destined to be here, they shouldn’t be here.
            
“I mean look at them.” Ivan pointed toward other friends of that injured man. “Wearing torn and ragged clothes. They don’t know how to clean themselves. On one side there are us for whom this world breathe and on other side these useless…. Gross.”
            
Grumbling of Ivan stopped only when he was again on his way and there was no useless life to hinder his journey.
Then after couple of minutes he was at the backstage and getting ready for his another much awaited performance when he saw 'it' in the form of a drum, looking toward him from a short distance.
            
“You came again.” Said Ivan very lightly. “I have a good news for you. I gave you an name. Bug, this is what I am going to call you.”
“Bug?” Said Drum, the Bug. “Okay you can call me whatever you want.”
“So what do you want this time?” Asked Ivan.
            
“Same old thing.” Said the bug. “I want your permission.”
“Again that same thing.” Fretted Ivan.
“Yes.” Said the bug. “Just give me your permission to make your life as beautiful as a blessed dream.”
            
“Oh please.” Grumbled Ivan. “Like I want you to.
“I can’t touch you because of course you are a illusion.” Continued Ivan. “Otherwise I have had ripped you in half or have eaten you when you are in the form of that disgusted cheese burger or whatever.”
“It's not about eating or smashing me.” Said the bug. “It's about you. It’s your only chance to live your life happily ever after.”
            
“Do you have a mind?” Asked Ivan. “Can't you see the life I have right now. You should come with me when I will be performing. Girls rip their clothes apart in excitement when they listen me singing. That’s how much they love me. So what more can you give me disgusted creature?”
“Okay I will ask you one last time and then it will be farewell.” Said bug. “Do I have your permission?”
“ Noooo.” Enunciated Ivan. “Do you want me to say it in any other way?” 
            
“No it’s fine.” Said bug as it stood up and started vanishing into thin air. “Farewell my friend.”
“Hun.” Beamed Ivan and he walked toward the curtain ahead of which a crowd of fans was cheering his name.
As he removed that white curtain, a bright white light hit his both eyes.
            
“Ivan”.. “Ivan” He listened his name and then he woke up. At that time two of the junior doctors were checking his eyes with flash lights.
“He is awake!” Said one doctor.
“Oh thank god.” Said another.
            
For a second he was unable to gasp everything happening around him and then he recalled his real life.
He is a 17 year old kid brought here from his slum area only to take part in the tests of a virtual reality machine which is launching today and available for rich people from around the world. Scavenging is what he does for living.
            
“How much time has passed?” Asked Ivan.
“It’s half an hour.” Said doctor and yet Ivan has experienced a whole life.
            
“Forgive us. Virtual trips has been meant to last only 10 minutes but there seems to be a problem particularly in your machine.”
“What kind of problem?” Asked Ivan.
            
“We don’t know for sure but it was a kind of bug in the machine, restricting you from leaving that virtual reality.” Said doctor. “It’s good that you are back or we have to kept you like this for ever because it is very dangerous to separate machine and user without a proper detaching process. And as the agreement says if you haven’t woke up then company had to accept you like this. Of course it would have cost them a lot of money.”
            
“Hurry, give these slums their money as promised and make them leave this place as soon as possible.” Bawled senior doctor. “We can’t let our customers see these slums around here.”
            
In a matter of seconds he got his 50 bucks and as he came outside, 3 of his other friends who were also in testing process, joined him.
“That was some serious shit.” Said Asif, one of the members of their Baaghi group. “It was an whole life I experienced there.”
            
“This is where these rich douche bags burn their money, my friend.” Said Marine, head of their group. “Don’t worry they will pay for it.”
“Yes at last they will get what they deserve.” Said Momo another member of their Baaghi group. “A kick on their white ass.”
            
They all snorted and laughed except Ivan who was lost in everything that happened to him.
“What's the matter Ivan?” Asked Marine. “All thanks to you, today it will gonna be the biggest stroke on them.”
“What?” Snapped Ivan.
            
“I said we owe you an big celebration.” Said Marine. “Scavenging is not for today. Today we will celebrate our victory.”
“O no. My head is a little messed up right now.” Said Ivan. “I want to sleep for few hours then I will join you in the evening.”
“Okay Fine. That was some messy stuff I agree on that. Even I am feeling a little dizzy right now.” Said Marine. “But meet us in the evening at our place.”
            
“Yeah sure.” Replied Ivan. After that those three was on their way to celebrate at their home in slum area.
After they vanished from his eyes, he pulled out his almost-damaged-put-together-by-tapes cell phone from his pocket. He searched for a name and then contacted her.
            
“ Hello, Pia….. Yeah it’s something…. Important.” He said. “What are you doing right now…. Okay…. Can you please meet me…. Yes right now…. Thanks…. Please come at the hill I’ll meet you there…. Okay Bye.”
Then he hung up the phone. Pia is a childhood friend of Ivan. She grew up doing household chores in the houses of rich people like her mother and lives in a hovel near Ivan, around the scrap yard.
            
Pia has been more into the upscale area than Ivan. Ivan who is main participant of the Baaghi group, an undercover ghetto group, which has actively performed different kinds of social attacks to afflict the growth of high-class area, always hated the haves. On the other hand, Pia who is more around the rich people believes that what they have been doing is wrong and they can’t force their destiny for being poor on all the rich people. Although they both have completely different views towards life, Pia never leave a chance to call him her boyfriend even if Ivan don't take her too seriously and always talk with her in a hurry.
            
But today as he was walking toward the hill surrounding slum area, opposite to the high-class area, he needed her so badly. After going through this life changing experience she is the only person that he find suitable to talk with.
When he reached there, Pia was already waiting eagerly for him to arrive.
            
“So what’s the matter? You specially called me.” Said Pia thankfully as they both sat at the edge of the hill, facing the world. “You never did this before.”
            
Ivan remained silent for some time. “Pia why did you used to say so?”
“Say what?” Asked Pia.
“That what we were doing to rich people all along is wrong.” Said Ivan. “Why did you used to say those things.”
“It’s not a big thing. I knew that being born in a rich family is not their fault. And similarly if we born in poor families, it’s also not their fault.” Said Pia. “And because they were born and raised in those type of conditions, so sometimes it become difficult for them to comprehend our lives.”
            
“Not a big thing for you.” Said Ivan. “But some people need an extra life to learn these things.” 
“What are you talking about?” Asked Pia.
Again Ivan paused for some moments. “You know all the crazy stuff we kept doing to the rich. A few days ago I came up with an idea to hurt them more.” Gulped Ivan. “I came to know that those people have built some kind of machine for their pleasure by experiencing some other ideal virtual lives.
            
“ Amian a long time undercover member of our Baaghi group, living among the high class people, who share thoughts like us, told me about it because he himself was a part in the construction of the machine.
“So I suggested him that why can’t he vitiate the machine in order to attack their minds when they will be on those virtual realities. It will gonna be the biggest blow on them.
            
“He and all the other members of our group found this idea quite amazing. So Amian came up with a kind of virus that will stop them from leaving those virtual realities. He inserted those viruses into the machines. Virus insertion should be done while those machines were built because if they were completely built it would become impossible to vitiate them without being noticed.
            
“But the problem was that those machines have to pass the safety test phase with humans as test subjects. To avoid anyone outsider to knew about the virus, Amian tricked the company’s board members to choose test subjects from slum area, which they also find as a better idea because undesired and unimportant test subjects always benefit them.
“As they didn’t knew about us and our real intentions, with the recommendation from Amian, they chose us. Amian has made a way to temporarily reduce the effect of virus so that we can escape that virtual reality although I myself encountered one of those viruses too. I called it Bug.”
            
“Okay so again you have done something that I always told you not to.” Said Pia sadly. “And why are you telling me this now?”
“It’s because….” Ivan swither. “During that test I lived an alternate life forgetting all about reality. And I am very ashamed to tell you that when a life which is both rich and glorious is given to me, there I started seeing the poor people as a curse to that world. All this time I hated those rich people but now I came to realize how wrong I was.
            
“The thing is that it's not about regretting over my past mistakes but it is about what I have done now. Thousands of people will gonna suffer because of my mistake. Those machines may have been used by god knows how many people till now. And they all with their families will gonna suffer an ugly fate all because of me. There is no way to stop it.”
            
Pia who was listening to him very dearly, turned toward him and hold his face into her hands. “Don’t be silly. There always exist a way. Even without anything to survive, we have been living our life. Life was always a wild surviving adventure for us. And in this way of survival we sometimes do some things that we found most suitable at that point of time.”
            
“Too many mistakes throughout my life.” Said Ivan with crumbling voice. “You can’t even imagine how much pain, regression and fear I am feeling right now. How will I live knowing this?”
            
“I do Ivan. I know exactly the phase of your life you are going through.” Said Pia. “There exist always a way to make up for your mistakes and to live a better life.” Pia paused for a while. “Tell me don't you remember that time on my eighth birthday when instead of bringing me a pair of earrings from scrap yard, you ended up dumping me into the scrap.”
            
“Yeah I do.” Ivan smiled a little.
“I was so mad at you.” Said Pia. “But then you make up for it by buying a new dress for me the very next day. And that one time when you ate my lunch. You bought a delicious meal for me to make up for that.”
            
“Yeah I remember very vividly.” Laughed Ivan. “But the little difference is that.” Then he paused for few moments. “I have never bought the dress or meal to make up for those things. I always had this ego inside me that always stopped me from doing anything for you. I only imagined doing these things very vividly but in reality I never gave anything like this to you.”
            
For some moments Pia looked at him in some confusion while Ivan looked at her with a smile like sun in the morning.
“Pia tell me one thing.” Said Ivan very relaxed after what it seems decades to him. “Aren’t you…….. The bug of my life.”
After listening it Pia kept looking into his eyes and then she turned and looked at the horizon. “So you knew.” Conceded Pia.
            
“So I am still into the system, away from reality.” Said Ivan.
“Yes I just wanted you to stay with me.” Said Pia, the bug. “When you didn’t listened to me the first time, I showed you another life, a simulation of your possible future in reality that you will live if you permanently decides to leave the system. I know everything you know. I am in your mind. I just misunderstood those make up memories you have. I thought those were real.
            
“So now as you know the truth, you can leave the system whenever you want. No tricks this time. It will going to be your real life but remember one thing. If you woke up in real life then there is going to be no way for you to revert all this. Lots of people will pay because of your actions. On the other hand as you wanted a way to make things right, this is your way. If you live here, in reality you will transit into a coma like state, forcing them to immediately stop manufacturing and use of these devices.”
            
“You know Pia…. Or will I say bug.” Said Ivan. “You have won this battle. I will stay here. Virus that Amian made is very effective I must admit.” Then Ivan stood up and he inhaled until he was unable to breathe further. “Although I am hundred percent sure that what I am thinking about my reality is actually the reality. But there is no saying that you may be manipulating my memories and thoughts, forcing me to live here because anyway you are in my mind and designed specifically to do so.
            
“But nonetheless, now I don’t care what my reality is. Living these lives and after experiencing all this, I don’t want to live anymore. Living a life is just a battle of wills. No matter if you are rich or poor or what life you are living, humans are bound to feel emotions and those emotions will always leave you fighting for what is right and what is wrong.
            
“Oh I am so relaxed right now. I don’t even have words to describe this feeling.” Then he closed his eyes and raised his arms. “Bug please make everything around me just go away. Take me into a state where all the feeling will be lost. Take me into nothingness. I want to feel Nirvana. Just let me find out who I am and why we have to live. And please do one more thing. Take away this body. Let me with just my consciousness or what some will call as soul.”
            
“As you wish.” Said the bug as everything there slowly dissolved into a dark black state of nothingness.
